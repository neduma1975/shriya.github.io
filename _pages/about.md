I'm a passionate student dedicated to advancing human-robot interaction, soft robotics, and accessible design. My work focuses on creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between humans and technology, making robotics more intuitive and beneficial for society.

## Research & Academic Journey

My research spans multiple prestigious institutions where I've contributed to cutting-edge projects in robotics and human-computer interaction:

- **NeuroRobotics Lab (University of Utah)**: Conducting research in neural interfaces and robotic systems that enhance human capabilities
- **Purdue Wachs Lab**: Working on advanced human-robot interaction methodologies and interface design
- **SJSU ARAS Lab**: Contributing to autonomous robotic systems and their practical applications

## Current Focus

I'm currently developing **soft SRL (Soft Robotic Learning)** systems and working on a **stroke rehabilitation handle** that leverages soft robotics principles to provide more natural and effective therapy for stroke patients. This work represents my commitment to using technology for healthcare and accessibility.

## Community Leadership & Impact

Beyond research, I'm deeply involved in community service and education:

- **seEDucation Founder**: Leading initiatives to promote STEM education and make robotics accessible to underrepresented communities
- **Bobaionics Captain**: Leading a robotics team focused on innovative solutions and community outreach

## Skills & Interests

My expertise spans:
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Designing intuitive interfaces between humans and robotic systems
- **Soft Robotics**: Developing flexible, adaptive robotic systems inspired by biological structures
- **Accessible Design**: Creating technology solutions that serve diverse populations
- **Video Editing**: Combining technical skills with creative storytelling to communicate complex concepts

## Vision

I believe in the power of technology to enhance human capabilities while maintaining accessibility and inclusivity. My goal is to develop robotic systems that not only advance the field technically but also create meaningful impact in healthcare, education, and daily life.
